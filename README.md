# SC_Auth

A full login authorization and user management library for CodeIgniter4.

## Development Roadmap
As CodeIgniter4 is in its way, an authentication library needed. This project aims to build a new authentication library for CodeIgniter4 that is simple, easy to use, and have full functionality. 

**There is no promise to release the beta version of this project before CodeIgniter4 beta version is released, anyway we will do our best.**

### Phase-1
* User Management and Operations (login, logout, register, verification via e-mail, forgotten password, user ban, login CAPTCHA and Login attempts)
* Group Operations (creating/deleting groups, membership management)
* Admin user support
* Permission Management (creating/deleting permissions)
* Grouping permissions (can group permissions for each page or module or make any group that will help displaying organized permissions)
* Menu support (adding menu items, menu permissions, menu Generator to generte menu for each user depending on its permissions)
* Group Permissions
* User Permissions

### Phase-2
Those features are still in study and hoping to be able supporting them:
* JWT support for password less authentication.
* OAuth 2 support to connect using (Facebook, Google...)
